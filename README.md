# MillerRabin
Some primality test programs like [Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_primality_test) and [Miller-Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test), written in Python.

This repository contains code that I used and explained in an article for c't magazine (01/2023). You can find the article on [heise online](https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Kryptografie-Riesige-Primzahlen-fuer-sichere-Verschluesselungen-finden-7370508.html).
